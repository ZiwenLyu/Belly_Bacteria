# Belly_Bacteria

## Project Overview
Some bacteria species can synthesize proteins that taste like beef and provide another choices for vegetarians. Researcher Roza cooperates with the starup company Improbabe Beef to look for bacteria candidates. Roza hypothesizes that such ideal microorganism can be found on the human bodies in the belly button. So she has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacteria species living in their belly buttons. This project uncovers and documents bacteria in volunteers' belly button. Each volunteer's identity is anonymous and we assign them with ID numbers. You can choose their ID in the dropdown menu to discover their navel's bacteria on the dashboard.
